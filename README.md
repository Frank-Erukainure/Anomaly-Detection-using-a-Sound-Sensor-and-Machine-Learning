# Anomaly-Detection-using-a-Sound-Sensor-and-Machine-Learning
This project is about detecting anomaly in a rotating machine using Random Forest Classifier and SVM. A simple rotating fan with a sound sensor (microphone) was used for the experiment. The project report PDF file is attached (the same PDF as the Gesture Recognition project, but refer to section 3).
